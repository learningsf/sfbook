Founding the Fortress

\begin_layout Standard
Once you reach level 25 you will be allowed to build the Fortress building.
 It's the main one in the Fortress screen and determines the wood and stone
 capacity of your storage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The level of Fortress building also determines the amount of wood and stone
 rewards you get from wheel of fortune, dice or quests during the Fortress
 event.

\begin_layout Standard
This is an important point, so will get back to it again later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
What not to build
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without further ado, we have to first tell you which buildings to keep level
 1 forever and never upgrade beyond that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Never upgrade Fortification wall!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Never upgrade Mage Tower!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Never upgrade Archery!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Never buy Archers and Mages, only buy Soldiers!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider that not building defence buildings or units is a sacred law that
 should never be broken.
 Actually you don't have to take our word for it, as there is a reasonable
 explanation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every time someone attacks and defeats your Fortress, you get 24 hour protection.
 During that time other players can't steal anything from your main storage,
 they only take 50% of your woodcutter and stone quarry (for brevity we
 will call those 'mines'), and also a bonus that is not substracted from
 your resources, but is given to them from the game out of thin air.
 With each attack your protection is extended with another 24 hours, and
 as that usually happens every 5 minutes, it last almost forever (as long
 as people continue attacking you).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
imgleft{./images/wood-stone.png}
\end_layout

\end_inset

If you have no wood or stone in your mines, other players steal nothing
 from you, and only receive the bonus that the game gives them.
 The amount of that bonus depends on the level of your woodcutter and stone
 quarry, so the higher the level of those, the better the chances other
 players will be motivated to attack you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, if you upgrade the wall or build defence units, less
 people will attack you.
 Thus protection won't be extended and will expire.
 And when someone attacks you without protection, they steal 10% of your
 main storage, which is much more than the 50% in your mines (which are
 usually empty anyway).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not only that, but you will also have less chances to counter-attack, as
 few people will attack you in the first place, because of the strong defence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Early build order
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you build Fortress level
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

1, you can buy the Fortress mushroom pack.
 It gives you 100000 wood and 50000 stone.
 Most important things to build with those resources are Fortress level
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

6 and Hall of Knights
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

6 (HoK 6).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Total guild HoK is important as it influences the stats of gems everyone
 in the guild receives.
 And getting better gems early helps to defeat dungeons, raids and portals
 faster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this reason you could first use the resources from the Fortress pack
 to build:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fortress 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
HoK upgrade 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Laborers' Quarters 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fortress 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
HoK upgrade 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Laborers' Quarters 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fortress 3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
HoK upgrade 3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Laborers' Quarters 3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fortress 4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
HoK upgrade 4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Laborers' Quarters 4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fortress 5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
HoK upgrade 5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Laborers' Quarters 5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fortress 6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
HoK upgrade 6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Laborers' Quarters 6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ambitious guilds often skip building of everything up to HoK
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

6 (costs ~132 mushrooms) at the very start of the server.
 That helps them to reach total guild HoK of 300 as early as day 2 of server.
 And HoK 300 means +100 stats for your gems (compared to HoK
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

0).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next most important buildings to have at that early stage are only level
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

1 of Gem Mine and levels 1-5 of Woodcutter and Stone Quarry:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Gem Mine 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Woodcutter 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Stone Quarry 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Woodcutter 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Stone Quarry 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Woodcutter 3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Stone Quarry 3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Woodcutter 4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Stone Quarry 4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Woodcutter 5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Stone Quarry 5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gem Mine is necessary as this is where you find gems, and equipping gems
 in socketed items gives them additional attribute points (stats).
 Once you unlock gems you should try to wear only socketed items, even if
 they are not epic, as a normal socketed item is better than an epic item
 with no socket (unless the non-epic item has wrong attributes, or is older,
 or your guild has too low HoK).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You need a decent level of Woodcutter and Stone Quarry in order to become
 an attractive target for others to attack, thus having more chances to
 counter-attack yourself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And in order to do any attacks at all, you also need a decent level of Barracks
 too.
 Each level of barracks gives you 3 soldiers.
 It takes 10 minutes to rebuild a single soldier, so, if you have Barracks
 6, it would be enough to make 18 fortress attacks once per 3 hours, without
 losing a single chance for attack:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Barracks 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Barracks 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Barracks 3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Barracks 4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Barracks 5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Barracks 6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All buildings listed above cost 66Â 201 wood and 23Â 320 stone, so once those
 are ready, you will have some materials left for Fortress
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

7 and Laborers' Quarters
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

7 too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the inital 48 protection on new servers, your main source of wood
 and stone become fortress attacks, events and wheel (later dice too).
 Mines (Woodcutter and Stone Quarry, called mines for brevity) are only
 relevant as a means to attract others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Gotchas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Keep Gem Mine at level 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned above you need Gem Mine level
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

1 early.
 As early as you can.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gems are important, but there is a gotcha that catches many players.
 Often new players assume that the higher the level of the mine, the better.
 It is, but not early in the game.
 Upgrading Gem Mine before level 70 (even to level 2) is consired a mistake,
 and truly slows you down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each level of Gem Mine slightly improves the stats of the gems you receive,
 but there is a trade off.
 With each next level the price of gems increases (they cost more gold,
 wood and stone), and so does the time required to mine a gem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, with Gem Mine level
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

1 a single gem costs 150 gold, 2 wood and 1 stone, and takes 42 minutes
 to find a gem (with Laborers' Quarters level
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

6, also called just Lab).
 In comparision, with Gem Mine level
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

6 gems cost 900 gold, 400 wood and 133 stone, and take 5 hours and 36 minutes
 to harvest (with same level of Lab).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you can see the time needed to find a gem inflates a lot with each next
 level, which means you get less gems.
 Unfortunately you can't use all gems, as only the right gems for your character
 are useful, so that means you could wait for hours for a single gem only
 to find it is for the wrong class (yep, the RNG god often gives you gems
 for other classes, or luck gems, which are considered useless).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What's worse, the gold price also inflates a lot, at before level 50 you
 will find it hard to collect enough gold even for the gems that cost only
 150 gold.
 So early in the game you level up quickly and need that gold for so many
 other things (stats, guild skills, starting raids, buying epics).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And on top of all that, the longer the time needed to mine a gem, the more
 expensive it is to skip waiting with mushrooms.
 This is the very reason why fast-leveling try-hard players keep Gem Mine
 to level
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

1 until their character reaches 220-230 level.
 To level up quickly they need to change gems very often, and having the
 mine at level
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

1 means that skipping a single gem costs only a few mushrooms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Don't upgrade Smithy beyond level 9
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At server start, don't rush to build the Smithy yet.
 Do that only when you can't win enough attacks anymore (usually around
 the time you have Fortress 10-11 ready).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Level
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

9 of Smithy allows you to upgrade your soldiers to level 70, and at that
 level training one soldier costs 346 wood and 112 stone.
 At the beginning of a new server level 70 is more than adequate to defeat
 just enough opponents, and the cost of the soldiers is low enough to allow
 you to attack opponents that give no resources, just to force a change
 of the opponent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You might even manage to do just fine without ever building Smithy.
 Possible if you manage to find active players to exchange fortress counter-atta
cks with (check the Finding a fortress buddy section below for whys and
 hows), and if those players have no defences (no one should, right?).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Fortress attacks after 48-h protection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the initial protection on the server is over, your main source of
 wood and stone become:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fortress attacks and counter-attacks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Rewards from quests during Fortress event (the Fantastic Fortress Festivity
 event)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 20 spins of wheel of fortune (especially during Fortress events, as
 reward is x2)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The dice game (after you unlock Tower)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fortress attacks give much more wood and stone than you could collect from
 the Woodcutter or Stone Quarry.
 Each server is different in that regard, but still it's pretty common to
 regularly find fortress attacks that give more than 4K wood and 1K stone:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
imgfull{./images/common-fort-attack.png}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But to make use of that you need to attack other fortresses multiple times
 per day.
 How often depends on the level of Barracks.
 As was already explained earlier, each level of Barracks give you 3 soldiers,
 and you want a minimum of 18 soldiers in order to be able to not lose any
 chances for attacks, while keeping your sanity by not having to make those
 too often.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Always attack with one soldier.

 do that.

Instead, go to MAIL->BATTLES and find a Fortress defence to counter-attack
 with 1 soldier.
 By doing a counter-attack you gain resources, and also change the opponent
 for free.
 Always check Fortress defences from the bottom of the list first, cause
 the bottom ones disappear first.

\begin_layout Standard
After counter-attack check again what is the next available Fortress attack
 from FORTRESS->ATTACK .
 If it would be successful with 1 soldier do that.
 If not go to Mail->Battles again and search for another counter-attack.
 Repeat that until you have no soldiers left and build new soldiers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also choose the best counter-attacks (that give the most wood and
 stone) instead of just doing the one at the bottom at the list.
 For me collecting stone is harder, so I always choose attacks with most
 stone, ignoring wood when comparing.
 Try to find attacks that give 1K stone or close to that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you do it long enough you will know the names of the players that give
 most resources by heart.
 Some of them will start to counter-attack you, if your wood and stone mines
 are high level enough (stop at level 10).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have such attacks that you know that give lots of resources, but
 have not soldiers to return the attack, you can save it for later by putting
 a checkmark in front of it.
 Once you do that it will go at the top of the list and will stay there
 until you uncheck it.

Important buildings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most important buildings you should focus on are Fortress, Gem Mine,
 Academy and Teasury:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Laborer Quarters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(further called just Lab), as each level of it reduces by 5% building time
 and time needed to find gems.
 Usually this is the first building to upgrade immediately after building
 next level of Fortress, always keeping it same level as Fortress.
 Though people who push for HoK 15 early, stop upgrading the Lab at level
 11 or 12, and continue building it only once they have HoK 15.
 And since Lab is important, if you follow this approach, you should immediately
 upgrade it to level 15 (the max level) as soon as you have bought the HoK
 15 upgrade.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Fortress,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
because the amount of the rewards you get from quests during the Forest
 event, and also the amounts you get from the wheel of fortune and the dice
 game, depend on the level of your Fortress building.
 Each level of Fortress doubles those amounts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Gem Mine,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
because it improves the stats of the gems you receive.
 There are different approaches on when to start upgrading the Gem Mine.
 What most players do is to start upgrading it sometime after level 70-80,
 and have it at level 10 by the time they are level 100-110.
 The reason is that at that level they are very close to reaching the Tower
 dungeon, and having Gem Mine of level 10 is the other requirement to unlock
 the Underworld.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It as already explained how long you should keep Gem Mine at level 1 before
 upgrading it to level 10.
 People also often ask when to start upgrading it beyond level 10.
 As you already know the higher the level of that mine, the longer it takes
 to find gems, and the more wood and stone they cost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It does not take much time for your character to reach level 215-225, and
 that is completely possible with Gem Mine 10 (even with Gem Mine 1).
 Quickly reaching those levels means you need to change gems with better
 ones more often (as stats of gems depend also on your character level).
 That is why it is not advisable to even think about making it level 11
 before your char has leveled up to 225.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can say that leveling up from 225 to 315 is also not that slow, so keeping
 Gem Mine at level 10 throughout those levels is generally a good plan,
 again, allowing you to change gems for your char and your companions more
 often.
 Around level 315 dungeon monsters become much more harder and progress
 slows down.
 That's why level 300 is a pretty good moment to start upgrading the Gem
 Mine beyond level 10 (eg.
 at least to level 13-14), without ignoring too much the other important
 buildings.

Academy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
is not very useful early as it gives too little XP when your character is
 lower level.
 Still, if you completely ignore it, you will lose lots of XP later on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My approach is to usually upgrade Academy to level 10 after getting Gem
 Mine to level 10 and Laborer Quarters to level 11, and then keep it at
 that level until I have HoK 15 and Fortress 17-18.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Teasury
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
determines how many slots for items you have in your backpack.
 And space in backpack is never enough.
 It's considered especially important at higher levels (eg.
 around 370 level), as by that time you already find normal items that sell
 for 5M gold to the witch.
 And 5M is half of a stat point.
 You also need some free space for backup items with quest runes (max 8
 slots for that), and some to save epic items for toilet (minimum 3, to
 be able to save at least 3 items for Toilet events).
 All this just goes to show that upgrading Teasury is never a mistake.
