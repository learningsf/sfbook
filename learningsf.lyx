Choosing a character class

People often ask which class is the best.
 There is no right answer, but each of them has its pros and cons.
 Knowing those can help you make a choice that suits your play-style and
 is strong in the parts of the game you find most important.

Founding the Fortress
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you reach level 25 you will be allowed to build the Fortress building.
 It's the main one in the Fortress screen and determines the wood and stone
 capacity of your storage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The level of the Fortress building also determines the amount of wood and
 stone rewards you get from wheel of fortune, dice or quests during the
 Fortress event.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
What not to build
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without further ado, we have to first tell you which buildings to keep at
 level 1 forever and never upgrade beyond that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Never upgrade Fortification wall!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Never upgrade Mage Tower!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Never upgrade Archery!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Never buy Archers and Mages, only buy Soldiers!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider that not building defense buildings or units is a sacred law that
 should never be broken.
 Actually you don't have to take our word for it, as there is a reasonable
 explanation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every time someone attacks and defeats your Fortress, you get 24 hour protection.
 During that time other players can't steal anything from your main storage,
 they only take 50% of your woodcutter and stone quarry (also called resource
 buildings), and also a bonus that is not substracted from your resources,
 but is given to them by the game, out of thin air.
 With each attack your protection is extended with another 24 hours, and
 as that usually happens every 5 minutes, it last almost forever (as long
 as people continue attacking you).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
imgleft{./images/wood-stone.png}
\end_layout

\end_inset

If you have no wood or stone in your woodcutter and stone quarry, other
 players steal nothing from you, and only receive the bonus that the game
 gives them.
 The amount of that bonus depends on the level of your woodcutter and stone
 quarry, so the higher the level of those, the better the chances other
 players will be motivated to attack you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, if you upgrade the wall or build defence units, less
 people will attack you.
 Thus protection won't be extended and will expire.
 And when someone attacks you without protection, they steal 10% of your
 main storage, which is much more than the 50% in your resource buildings
 (which are usually empty anyway).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not only that, but you will also have less chances to counter-attack, as
 few people will attack you in the first place, because of the strong defence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, have in mind that the amount of resources you receive from fortress
 attacks also depends on the Fortress level of yourself and your opponent.
 If your opponent has equal or higher Fortress level than you, then you
 get the full attack amount.
 If his Fortress level is lower than yours the amount is reduced, and if
 the difference is more than 3 levels, you win nothing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Early build order
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you build Fortress level
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

1, you can buy the Fortress mushroom pack.
 It gives you 100000 wood and 50000 stone.
 Most important things to build with those resources are Fortress level
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

6 and Hall of Knights
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

6 (HoK 6).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Total guild HoK is important as it influences the stats of gems everyone
 in the guild receives.
 And getting better gems early helps to defeat dungeons, raids and portals
 faster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this reason you could first use the resources from the Fortress pack
 to build:

Ambitious guilds often skip building of everything up to HoK
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

6 (costs ~132 mushrooms) at the very start of the server.
 That helps them to reach total guild HoK of 300 as early as day #2 of server.
 And HoK 300 means +100 stats for your gems (compared to HoK
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

0).

Next most important buildings to have at that early stage are only the first
 level of Gem Mine and levels 1-5 of Woodcutter and Stone Quarry:

\begin_layout Standard
Gem Mine is necessary as this is where you find gems, and equipping gems
 in socketed items gives them additional attribute points (stats).
 Once you unlock gems you should try to wear only socketed items, even if
 they are not epic, as a normal socketed item is better than an epic item
 with no socket (unless the non-epic item has wrong attributes, or is older,
 or your guild has too low HoK).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You need a decent level of Woodcutter and Stone Quarry in order to become
 an attractive target for others to attack, thus having more chances to
 counter-attack others yourself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And in order to do any attacks at all, you also need a decent level of Barracks
 too.
 Each level of barracks gives you 3 soldiers.
 It takes 10 minutes to rebuild a single soldier, so, if you have Barracks
 6, it would be enough to make 18 fortress attacks once per 3 hours, without
 losing a single chance for attack.

Keep Gem Mine at level 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned above you need Gem Mine level
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

1 early.
 As early as you can.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gems are important, but there is a gotcha that catches many players.
 Often new players assume that the higher the level of the mine, the better.
 It is, but not early in the game.
 Upgrading Gem Mine before level 70 (even to level 2) is considered a mistake,
 and truly slows you down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each level of Gem Mine slightly improves the stats of the gems you receive,
 but there is a trade off.
 With each next level the price of gems increases (they cost more gold,
 wood and stone), and so does the time required to mine them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, with Gem Mine level
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

1 a single gem costs 150 gold, 2 wood and 1 stone, and takes 42 minutes
 to find a gem (with Laborers' Quarters level
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

6, also called just Lab).
 In comparision, with Gem Mine level
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

6 gems cost 900 gold, 400 wood and 133 stone, and take 5 hours and 36 minutes
 to harvest (with same level of Lab).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you can see the time needed to find a gem inflates a lot with each next
 level, which means you get less gems.
 Unfortunately you can't use all gems, as only some gems are suitable for
 your character.
 That means you could have waited for hours for a single gem only to find
 it is for the wrong class (yep, the RNG god often gives you gems for other
 classes, or luck gems, which are considered useless).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What's worse, the gold price also inflates a lot, and before level 50 you
 will find it hard to collect enough even for the gems that cost only 150
 gold.
 Early in the game you level up quickly and need that gold for so many other
 things (guild skills, stats, starting raids, buying epics).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And on top of all that, the more time needed to mine a gem, the more expensive
 it is to skip waiting with mushrooms.
 This is the very reason why fast-leveling try-hard players keep Gem Mine
 at level
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

1 until their character reaches 215-225 level.
 To level up quickly they need to change gems very often, and having the
 mine at level
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

1 means that skipping a single gem costs only a few mushrooms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Don't upgrade Smithy beyond level 9
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At server start, don't rush to build the Smithy yet.
 Do that only when you can't win enough attacks anymore (usually around
 the time you have Fortress 10-11 ready).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Level
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

9 of Smithy allows you to upgrade your soldiers to level 70, and at that
 level training one soldier costs 346 wood and 112 stone.
 At the beginning of a new server level 70 is more than adequate to defeat
 just enough opponents, and the cost of the soldiers is low enough to allow
 you to attack opponents that give no resources, just to force a change
 of the opponent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You might even manage to do just fine without ever building Smithy.
 Possible if you manage to find active players to exchange fortress counter-atta
cks with, as long as those players have no defences (no one should, right?).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Fortress attacks after first 48-h

\begin_layout Standard
Fortress attacks give much more wood and stone than you could collect from
 the Woodcutter or Stone Quarry.
 Each server is different in that regard, but still it's pretty common to
 regularly find fortress attacks that give more than 4K wood and 1K stone:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But to make use of that you need to attack other fortresses multiple times
 per day.
 How often depends on the level of your Barracks.
 As was already explained earlier, each level of Barracks give you 3 soldiers,
 and you want a minimum of 18 soldiers in order to not lose any chances
 for attacks, while keeping your sanity by not having to make those too
 often.

After that check again what is the next available Fortress attack (F from

 If it would be successful with 1 soldier, do that.
 If not, go to MAILâž­BATTLES again, unpin the one you just did, and choose
 the next one to counter-attack.
 Repeat until you have no soldiers left and start training new soldiers.
 Training a soldier takes 10 minutes, so if you have Barracks 6, you can
 take a deserved brake and come back to do counter-attacks again in 3 hours.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Make this a routine and soon you will know by heart the names of the players
 that give the most resources.
 If you need a simple example on what attacks to look for, try to find ones
 that give 1K stone or more, or at least close to that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the players that you attack will start to counter-attack you too,
 as long as your woodcutter and stone quarry are leveled up enough (eg.
 at least to lvl 10).
 That way you will both have more chances for counter-attacks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Players often ask why one would want others to attack his fortress at all.
 The reason is that when someone attacks you, he receives more resources
 than you actually lose.
 You only lose 50% of the resources in your woodcutter and quarry (as long
 as you have protection), but the player attacking you is given an extra
 bonus.
 This bonus is not taken from you and depends on the level of your resource
 buildings.
 Same happens when you attack someone else.
 So by constantly counter-attacking each other, you both earn that extra
 bonus, which is much more than what you lose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you have no soldiers, but notice a Fortress defense that would give
 lots of resources, use the pin button to save it for later.
 Pinned defences move to the top and won't be lost when the list is overwritten
 with new messages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Maximizing wood/stone rewards
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's tempting for new players to just keep all buildings the same level.
 And since there is an achievement for upgrading all of them to level 15,
 many get tricked that this is the expected way to play.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But practice shows that some buildings are substantially more important
 than the rest, while others are so useless, that you don't ever need to
 upgrade them beyond level 1 (as was already explained in first section
 of this chapter).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most important building of all is undisputedly the Fortress building
 itself.
 And it's not because you need to build that just to please some Fortress
 deity, sacrificing your nerves and free time.
 As always, there is a reasonable explanation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First of all, the amount of the wood and stone rewards that you receive
 from the wheel of fortune, dice game and quests (quests can give wood and
 stone only during the Fortress event) depend on the level of the Fortress
 building.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

For example, you can expect the following wood and stone rewards with Fortress
 15:

\begin_layout Standard
As you can see above, with Fortress 15, a single quest during the Fortress
 event rewards you with 750K wood or 250K stone.
 How many of those quests you will be given during the event depends on
 pure luck.
 That is why it's impossible to calculate exactly how much wood and stone
 you can earn.
 Yet consider that getting 10+ quests with wood or stone rewards for a single
 day is pretty common (with 320 thirst per day), and netting +7M wood and
 +2M stone during the whole event is definitely not unusual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each level of Fortress almost doubles the amounts of those rewards.
 At level 20 of Fortress (the maximum Fortress level), you will see the

\begin_layout Standard
To make better use of the rewards during the event, you should plan what
 to build, trying to have the highest level of Fortress possible at the
 Friday morning, when it starts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a very useful website (https://en.4m7.de/sammelalbum/festung.php)
 that shows exactly how much resouces each of the Fortress buildings costs,
 and how much time it takes to build.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I can't recommend you to skip any building time with mushrooms, as that
 is very expensive.
 But if you really want and can afford to do that, at least limit yourself
 to skipping it only on the Fridays during Fortress events.
 If you skip only the remaining building time, completing the next Fortress
 level (exactly before starting quests or using dice/wheel), you will still
 benefit from nearly double rewards during the event, without even skipping
 a whole level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another well known way to maximize rewards is to choose the shortest quests
 during Fortress events.
 That is, the shortest quests that have no item/fruit/hourglass reward (you
 can't find resources with quests that give items/fruits/hourglasses).
 The goal is to do more quests with same thirst, and thus to have slightly
 better chance for getting more wood or stone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Important buildings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most important buildings you should focus on are Laborers' Quarters,
 Fortress, Gem Mine, Academy and Teasury:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Laborer Quarters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(often called just Lab), as for each level it reduces by 5% the building
 time and the time needed to find gems.
 Usually this is the first building to upgrade immediately after building
 a next level of Fortress (always keeping it same level as Fortress).
 Though, people who push for HoK 15 early stop upgrading the Lab at level
 12 (sometimes even at level 11), and continue building it only once they
 have HoK 15.
 And since Lab is important, if you follow this approach, you should immediately
 upgrade it to level 15 (the max level) as soon as you have bought the HoK
 15 upgrade.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Fortress,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
because, as was already explained in the previous section, the amount of
 the rewards you get from quests during the Forest event, and also the amounts
 you get from the wheel of fortune and the dice game, depend on the level
 of your Fortress building.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Gem Mine,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
because it improves the stats of the gems you receive.
 There are different approaches on when to start upgrading the Gem Mine.
 What most players do, is to start upgrading it sometime after level 70-80,
 and have it at level 10 by the time they reach level 100-110.
 The reason is that around those levels they are strong enough to clear
 the first 9 dungeons, and to unlock the Tower dungeon.
 And having Gem Mine level 10 and access to the Tower dungeon are the two
 requirements for unlocking the Underworld.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was already explained how long you should keep Gem Mine at level 1 before
 pushing it to level 10.
 People also often ask when to start upgrading it beyond level 10.
 As you already know, the higher the level of that mine, the longer it takes
 to find gems, and the more wood and stone they cost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It does not take much time for your character to reach level 215-225, and
 that is completely possible with Gem Mine 10 (even with Gem Mine 1).
 Quickly reaching those levels means you need to change gems with better
 ones more often (as stats of gems depend also on your character level).
 That is why it is not advisable to even think about making it level 11
 before your char has leveled up to 225.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can say that leveling up from 225 to 315 is also not that slow, so keeping
 Gem Mine at level 10 throughout those levels is generally a good plan,
 again, allowing you to change gems for your char and your companions more
 often.
 Around level 315 dungeon monsters become much more harder and progress
 slows down.
 That's why level 300 is a pretty good moment to start upgrading the Gem
 Mine beyond level 10 (eg.
 at least to level 13-14), without ignoring too much the other important
 buildings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever time you choose to do that, make sure that your Fortress is always
 at least 1 level (may be even 2 levels) above your Gem Mine, or you might
 find yourself short on wood and stone.
 This actually matters only if you don't have a serious fortress buddy to
 exchange counter-attacks with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I personally keep Gem Mine at level 10 until I have a Fortress of at least
 level 17 or even 18, then upgrade Gem Mine to level 13-14 as first priorty,
 before focusing on Fortress 20.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Academy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
is not very useful early as it gives too little XP when your character is
 low level.
 Still, if you completely ignore it, you will lose lots of XP later on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My approach is to usually upgrade Academy to level
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

10-11 after getting Gem Mine to level
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

10 and Laborers' Quarters to level
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

12, and to keep it at that level until I have Fortress
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

20.
 Upgrading Academy to level
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

20 is my first priority once my Fortress reaches the max level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you already have enough resources for next level of Fortress, you could
 also build a few levels of Academy (eg.
 to level 12-14) in between, when your Fortress is at level 17-18.
 It's good to have Academy
\begin_inset space ~

14 early, as at that level it can accumulate exactly 8 hours of XP.
 This means you don't lose any XP while you sleep.
 And if you sleep longer than that, just build 1 more level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Teasury
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
determines how many slots for items you have in your backpack.
 And space in backpack is never enough.
 It's considered especially important at higher levels (eg.
 around 370 level), as by that time you already find normal items that sell
 for 5M gold to the witch.
 And 5M is half of a stat point.
 You also need some free space for backup items with quest runes (max 8
 slots for that), and some to save epic items for toilet (minimum 3, to
 be able to save at least 3 items for Toilet events).
 All this just goes to show that upgrading Teasury is never a mistake.

\begin_layout Section
Planning for HoK 20
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fastest way to reach HoK
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

20 (the maximum), is to build Fortress
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

20 first (again, the maximum) and only then to buy all of the HoK upgrades.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, you can't stay with HoK
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

0 until you reach Fortress
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

20, since the quality of gems (stats) in your guild depends on everyones
 HoK, yours included.
 Actually the quality of the gems depends on your level, the level of your
 gem mine and the guild HoK.
 But early in the life of a new server players have low levels and Gem Mine
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

1, so the amount of the guild HoK has the most tangible effect at gem stats
 in the early game (and thus at progress in dungeons).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The good news is that all HoK upgrades until level
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

12 actually don't cost much, so there is no reason to save resources for
 the main building by not bying those.
 50 players with HoK
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

12 amount to total HoK of 600, which means +200 stats on your gems.
 That is more than enough even for the most ambitious and impatient players,
 who want to push dungeons and level up quickly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I often see players who are tricked to believe that small differences in
 HoK have a huge effect on their characters even at higher levels.
 Sometimes leaders and officers use small difference in HoK as a reason
 to kick and replace players (guilty, also happened to me several times).
 Others protest when someone in the guild has 1-2 less HoK than the average
 and use that as a reason to change guilds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As was already explained a HoK of 600 gives you +200 stats on your gems
 (1/3 of HoK), so if another guild has 660 HoK that means they can only
 get +20 stats on their gems.
 If you were level 50 those +20 stats could matter more, but at level 250+
 (when your Gem Mine is already level 10), those +20 stats can at best help
 you pass a single floor of a dungeon.
 Small differences are even more meaningless when you are close to the maximum
 (max is 1000 HoK, and that happens when your average guild level is at
 least 370+).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Deviated from the topic a bit, but seemed important to emphasize how insignifica
nt those small differences are.
 Now full ahead to HoK 20.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since HoK uprades from 13 to 20 are much more expensive, it makes sense
 to make some planning and change the approach once both your Fortress and
 HoK are level
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

12.
 Buying HoK
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

13 alone costs ~3M wood and ~1M stone.
 Getting that before Fortress
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

14 can delay you in collecting enough resources for the main building, which
 in turn would mean smaller rewards from dice and wheel, or the next Fortress
 event.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's why many players stop bying HoK upgrades at 12, and only continue
 to build Fortress until it's level
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

15.
 Once that is ready, they can afford to buy HoK
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

13-15 almost at once.
 Now you could ask why stop at Fortress
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

15 then, why not push to Fortress
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

20 and only then buy the upgrades.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As was already mentioned, you can't ignore HoK completely.
 Gem stats depend on that, but what's more important is that each player
 with HoK
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

15 in the guild increases everyone's chances to mine black gems.
 A popular belief is that each HoK
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

15 in the guild increases the chance with about 1%, so having 50 players
 with HoK
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

15 in your guild could give you a chance of 50% to mine a black gem (and
 +250 stats for your gems).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have HoK
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

15, make sure to first upgrade your Laborers' Quarters building to level
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

15.
 At that level it reduces both the building time and the time for mining
 of gems by 75%, so getting it should be your first priority.
 After that feel free to focus only on the Fortress building until it reaches
 its maximum level of 20.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Mid to late build order
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are different approaches to develop your Fortress.
 What was outlined above is a popular way to max out the main building and
 HoK, even if you are not too invested in fortress counter-attacks and have
 no intention to skip any building time.
 I will often give opionated advice in this book, trying to suggest an approach
 that works well for most people.
 To stay true to that, what follows next is a sample build plan for development
 of Fortress after level

\begin_layout Itemize
Once Academy is lvl 20 you need to

focus only on Treasury and Gem Mine
\series default
.
 Which one you push more depends on your style of play (note that 
\series bold
max level of Treasury is 50
\series default
 and 
\series bold
max level of Gem Mine is 100
\series default
):
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
If you want to be an efficient late-game player, you need more spaces in
 backpack (to save items for witch, epics for toilet events or dismantling).
 In that case push the Treasury much more than the Gem Mine.
 For example, you can upgrade the 
\series bold
Gem Mine
\series default
 to 
\series bold
level
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

17/18
\series default
 (so that you are not too weak in dungeons and fights), and then push 
\series bold
Treasury
\series default
 to 
\series bold
level
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

30+
\series default
 before touching Gem Mine again.
\begin_inset Newline linebreak
\end_inset


\series bold
Once Treasury is level 50
\series default
, keep building only 
\series bold
Gem Mine until it reaches level 100
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you want to be strong in mid game (here and now, not years later), at
 the cost of losing gold and arcane splinters (holy gold, who would do anything
 so outrageous, stop and think again), you can focus more on Gem Mine.
 If that's your choice, have in mind that there are already players with
 Gem Mine level
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

100 at old servers, and it's clear that Gem Mine levels from 50 to 100 barely
 improve your gem stats at all.
 So even if you choose this approach, there is 
\series bold
no reason to upgrade Gem Mine to more than level
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

50 before your Treasury is maxed out
\series default
.
 
\begin_inset Newline linebreak
\end_inset

Considering that, you could first upgrade 
\series bold
Gem Mine
\series default
 to 
\series bold
level
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

20
\series default
 (each Gem Mine level from 16 to 20 slightly reduces the mining time, and
 at level
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

20 is when you unlock an earth pet, if that matters to you), and 
\series bold
while mining new gems
\series default
 for your char and companions could 
\series bold
build a few levels of Treasury
\series default
.
 Next you could 
\series bold
focus at Gem Mine, until it reaches level
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

50
\series default
 (building a few Treasury levels here and there in between).
 Actually, after Gem Mine level
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

25 you are allowed to upgrade the Gem Mine and search for gems simultaneously,
 so you don't need to plan when to replace gems anymore.
\begin_inset Newline linebreak
\end_inset

Again, 
\series bold
once Gem Mine is level
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

50
\series default
 (or even 40), stop upgrading it and make sure to 
\series bold
max out Treasury to level
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

50
\series default
 before you continue with the Gem Mine.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At level 105 the Arena Manager mini-game unlocks.
 The goal is to gain runes, and once you collect 1000+, you can find items
 with rune bonuses.
 The more runes you have, the better those bonuses are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the picture above you can see that the arena money and runes you have
 already gained are shown at the left side.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You start with one arena attraction (the seat).
 Attractions generate arena money (even when you are not online and playing).
 The more you improve the attractions, the more money they generate.
 You use the money to improve the attractions, so they generate more money.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the money you invested in your arena since the last sacrifice are automatica
lly converted to runes.
 That amount of runes is shown at the right side, as part of the [SACRIFICE]
 button.
 You can collect those runes by clicking the sacrifice button, resetting
 all your arena progress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each rune gained increases with +5% the money profit from all attractions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
How to upgrade attractions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you start, improve the attraction that has the lowest MIN price.
 It's a good rule to follow even later, but it also depends on how close
 the attraction is to the next milestone (25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500,
 5000, 10000).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each time an attraction reaches such a milestone, it doubles its profit,
 and reduces the time required to fill the attraction with 1/3.
 So, it makes sense to first upgrade attractions that are closer to the
 next milestone, even if they have a higher MIN price.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Likewise, when two attractions have a similar MIN price, it's more efficient
 to upgrade the one with less upgrades.
 For example, if you upgrade an attraction that reached 100+, it will boost
 the overall profit more than if you would upgrade a higher attraction that
 reached 500+.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another rule you can follow for efficient progress, is to keep difference
 between two consecutive attractions between 50 and 100 upgrades.
 This remains true until the very end of that game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
How often to sacrifice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you start, if you have lots of time to rebuild the progress of the
 attractions, you can make first sacrifice when you have between 10 and
 20 runes waiting to be sacrificed.
 If you don't have too much time at that moment, wait for 20 runes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After that, until you collect about 1 million runes, sacrifice each time
 runes double their amount (the amount of runes waiting to be sacrificed
 at the button is the same as the amount of runes you have already gained).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's a good idea to sacrifice during the day, so you have enough time to
 rebuild attractions before the night.
 In this way they can accumulate more money while you sleep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the toilet attraction reaches 1000 (or even if it reaches 500), you
 should start to sacrifice more often, not waiting for runes to double anymore
 (more than once per day).
 
\series bold
The ideal is to sacrifice every time the toilet attraction fills (1 cycle
 of toilet)
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason for this is that last attractions generate the most arena cash,
 but they also have the largest amortization, so if you wait runes to double,
 amortization accumulates and last attractions are not that efficient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sacrificing each time the toilet attraction fills might be the fastest way,
 but since that takes way too much time, no one really does that.
 If you manage to sacrifice at least 5 times per day, you will still do
 better than most players.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
What boosts/offers to buy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What boosts to buy depends on your playstyle, so let's split that in 3 parts:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Completely free to play
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Don't buy boosts on the first attractions at all and don't buy any skip
 offers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you unlock last attraction, get both the speed and money boost for
 the toilet attraction (25+50 mushrooms).
 It takes time to collect those, but it's worth it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason for buying boosts for last attraction only is that 
\series bold
each attraction generates almost as much as all other earlier attractions
 combined together
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Minimal usage of mushrooms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Don't buy boosts on the first attractions at all and don't buy any skip
 offers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you unlock last two attractions (the toilet and straying monster),
 get both the speed and money boost for both of them (25+50+75+100 mushrooms).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Limited use of mushrooms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At first buy both the speed and money boosts for the first attraction only
 (the seat).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After that buy several 7-day skips in order to reach 1 million runes faster.
 At that amount you can find items with '+2% Hit point' runes.
 Equip 8 such items, and you will have a total of +15% extra hit points
 (the maximum you can get is +15%).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have those you can continue buying skip offers here and there,
 until you unlock the last 4 attractions.
 When that happens, buy both boosts for those last 4 attractions (toilet,
 straying monster, snacks and VIP seat).
 All those boosts (plus the first seat) cost 1300 mushrooms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only continue buying 7-day skip offers until you reach 25% damage bonus.
 Following this start buying them only occasionally, for example if you
 feel it gets so slow that you just can't stand that (eg.
 between Tredecillion and Quattuordecillion).
 Check one of the next sections on tips how to force the merchant to offer
 you 7-day skips every day, even if you don't have all boosts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having 25% damage runes on the weapon will help you push early dungeons
 more easily.
 About the same time rune generation slows down to a crawl, so even if you
 had all boosts, you would still need to wait quite some time before you
 can equip any better weapon runes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And by the time you make progress to +30% damage runes, dungeons will be
 so difficult that those won't help you clear more than a few dungeon floors.
 In fact even the maximum of +60% damage bonus does not help too much.
 At best it will assist you to clear several floors and gain 1-2 levels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Fastest way to max bonuses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to unlock the max rune bonuses in the fastest way possible,
 you need to buy absolutely all boosts, including the platinum ones (platinum
 boosts become available only after you have all speed and gold boosts),
 and to buy 7-day skips daily for about 100 days.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It costs 4300 mushrooms to buy all of them (including platinum boosts) and
 about 3000 mushrooms to buy enough 7-day skips.
 Of course that is expensive and not worth it.
 You can buy much less boosts and skips, and still reach the maximum bonuses
 in 6-12 months.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Getting 7-day skip offers daily
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a trick to force 7-day skips daily:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Set an alarm about 1-2 hours before next arena offer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When alarm rings, sacrifice arena progress, and only upgrade the seat, and
 the attractions that you already have both boosts for (eg.
 monster and toilet only).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Set another alarm for 1 minute after next arena offer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When alarm rings, open the offer (it is important to open the offer before
 improving other attractions, as offer is calculated the moment you open
 it, not when time expires).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Merchant can only offer you boosts for attractions that you are currently
 developing
\series default
, so he will be forced to offer you either a boost for the seat or offers
 for skips.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If there is a 7-day skip, don't rush to buy the offer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Set another alarm for 15-30 minutes before the offer expires.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Immediately start increasing all attractions in order to develop them as
 much as possible before accepting the 7-day skip.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When alarm fires buy the 7-day skip.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
What runes to choose for equipment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every player should have three sets of items (gear):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
main/fighting set - with runes for fights
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
questing set - with runes for quests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
shopping set - for refreshing shops and Legendary Dungeon
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
The main/fighting set
\series default
 should have items with total of '+15% hitpoint' runes.
 If you have unlocked 5% hitpoint runes (some time after 1 Nonillion), you
 need only 3 items with such a rune, and can use the rest slots for other
 runes ('+Improved item quality' is the next best):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
3 items with '+5% Hit point' runes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
3 items with '+2 Improved item' quality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
2 items with resistance (or you can keep those 2 with hit point runes too,
 so you don't have to swap runes that often).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
The questing set
\series default
 should contain items with a total of '+10% XP bonus' and '+50% Gold bonus'
 (the maximum allowed).
 The '+XP bonus' runes are more important than '+Gold bonus' ones, so if
 you can't have both yet, focus on the XP ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It doesn't take much time to unlock '+3% XP bonus' runes.
 When that happens (after 10 Septillion) the questing set should contain:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
2 items with '+3% XP bonus' runes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
2 items with '+2% XP bonus' runes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
4 items with '+12-13% Gold bonus' runes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
The Shopping set
\series default
 should contain items with total of '+5 Improved item quality' and '+50%
 Chance of epics', and again, improved item quality is more important than
 increased chance of epics, so if you can't have both, focus on the first
 one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Once you hit 100+ Quindecillion runes
\series default
, you can completely get rid of the questing set, as you can equip your
 main/fighting gear with both:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

Using the Mannequin
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you collect 1000 runes you can find the Mannequin in the weapon shop.
 It takes a while, so don't expect to find it at the same day, unless you
 refresh the shop with mushrooms (can take +25 mushrooms).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is not much to explain about the Mannequin.
 It's where you put your questing set of items, and you can switch between
 your main gear and the one on the mannequin with a single click.

Surviving to max runes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's good to know when you can expect to have maximum rune bonuses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without any skips, if you have both boosts on last two attractions, it will
 take you about 2 years to reach the max bonuses, as long as you sacrifice
 +10 times per day.
 If you sacrifice less often than that, it can take you several months longer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Situation improves a lot if you can buy some boosts or skips:

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After you unlock the Tower dungeon, you can find the key to the Underworld
 (The Hearth of Darkness) in the gem mine, if you have Gem Mine level 10
 or higher.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can access the Underworld from the Fortress menu (use the coin icon).
 Similarly to the Fortress, there is also a main building here (The Hearth
 of Darkness), and its level determines what structures are available to
 build.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To buy anything in the Underworld you need to have souls (and some minimal
 gold).
 Unlike the Fortress, the building that determines the capacity of your
 resource storage is not the main structure, but the Soul Extractor.
 As such it is the Extractor that determines the amount of rewards during
 the Days of Doomed Souls event (we'll call that just the Souls event) and
 also how much souls you get from dice and wheel of fortune.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
What not to build
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before you learn anything more about the Underworld, you need to know which
 are the least important structures:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Do not build Troll Block until everything else is level 15!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Do not build Goblin pit until everything else is level 15!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Level 15 is the maximum construction level for everything in the Underworld,
 except for the Gold Pit.
 But in order to continue upgrading the pit to level 100, you first need
 to max out all other buildings.
 That is why even if the two structures above are completely useless, you
 still need to upgrade them to the maximum at some point, in order to continue
 with the Gold Pit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Important buildings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to the Fortress, the most important building here is the one that
 determines the capacity of the storage, and that is the Soul Extractor.
 So upgrading that should be your first priority and you should keep it
 several levels above all other structures until it reaches level
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

13.
 With Soul Extractor
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

13 you get so much resources from quests during the Souls event, that you
 can collect enough souls to completely finish the other two most important
 buildings.
 And those are the Gladiator Trainer and the Adventuromatic (also known
 as the Time Machine).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each level of the Gladiator Trainer increases the damage of your critical
 hits with +5% in all types of fights (dungeons, arena, guild fights, pet
 fights).
 At the maximum level of 15, this building brings you +75% critical damage
 (damage for critical hits is displayed in red during fight replays).
 Needless to say that having nearly double critical damage is huge, and
 you want it as soon as possible, as it helps to defeat more dungeons earlier.
 The Gladiator damage bonus is also applied to critical hits in pet dungeons.
 Having a Gladiator of level 13+ helps to get a decent chance of defeating
 the important pets in the habitat dungeons (even the very last pets).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next most important is the Adventuromatic.
 It's primary useful feature is that it generates some bonus thirst for
 you.
 The amount depends on the level of the building (+1 thirst for each level
 from 1 to 10 and +2 for each level from 11 to 15).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It generates thirst daily, but there is no need to collect it daily.
 The bonus thirst accumulates over time, and you can use it anytime you
 decide.
 So, at level 15 the Adventuromatic gives you +20 thirst daily, which obviously
 makes this structure also a high priority.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But collecting souls from the extractor or earning them in quests during
 the Souls event is not the only source of underworld resources.
 A significant way to reap more souls is by luring heroes (making underworld
 attacks).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's why next on the list is the Underworld Gate.
 Since the summer update of 2020, the first 5 levels of that building increase
 the number of heroes you can lure daily by 1.
 Levels from 6 to 15 increase the amount of souls you get from each hero
 with 20%.
 That update made the Underworld Gate similar in function to the Torture
 Chamber.
 Yet, not only the gate gives +20% souls for each level (compared to only
 +10% for the Torture Chamber), but it is also much cheaper to build than
 the chamber.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to win any attacks you also need to have an underworld unit that
 will fight with those heroes.
 The only unit worth the investment is the Keeper.
 To make it stronger you need to upgrade both the level of its building,
 and also the level of the unit itself.
 Since both cost precious souls, you only need to upgrade them just enough
 to be able to defeat the strongest player on the server.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Players in most guilds usually share with other members lists of suitable
 heroes to attack in underworld.
 Those heroes are most often players with no equipment and varying levels.
 You need players with different levels, as the amount of souls reaped depends
 on the level of the hero you defeat.
 But there is also a maximum threshold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You start with a threshold of 1, which means that even if you are capable
 of defeating a player of level 20, you still get only as much souls as
 you would get, if you defeated a hero of level 1.
 The way to increase that threshold is by making successful attacks only.
 Each successful attack increases the threshold by 1, whereas losing an
 attack reduces it by 5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finding players with no equipment to attack (and low enough level, so you
 can defeat it with the level of your Keeper building/unit) means you are
 nearly guaranteed to win.
 Doing that 5 times per day raises the threshold by 5, at least until you
 can't anymore find any easy targets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once that happens, it's time to consider upgrading your Keeper a bit.
 Usually you want to keep the Keeper unit (pun intended) a level that is
 close to the level of the target heroes.
 As long as upgrading the Keeper unit is much cheaper than upgrading the
 Keeper building, do that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Soul rewards
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was already emphasized that the most important building to have early
 on is the Soul Extractor, and the reason is, that it's level determine
 the amount of rewards from quests (during the Souls event only), dice and
 wheel of fortune.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Actually rewards from dice and wheel are so small, that they only play a
 role in the very beginning.
 That's not the case with the souls you get from quests during the Souls
 event.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To demonstrate that, here is a comparison of rewards with different levels
 of the Soul Extractor building:

In general, Underworld is not difficult to max out (except the Gold pit),
 so spending mushrooms on skipping of building time is not worth it, unless

But first levels of those are cheap enough, so you could adapt the build
 order and start working on them earlier.
 Assume it's situational.
 If a Souls event is on the door, focus on Extractor, if not, build a few
 early levels of those.

\begin_layout Standard
Next goal is to get Souls Extractor to level

13.
 But since that is a bit expensive in terms of souls, you should construct
 a few levels of the other important buildings in between:

The Keeper building is not listed in above table, but that does not mean
 you should ignore it completely.
 When to upgrade it, depends a lot on what is the level of your current
 hero targets.
 If you've already reached a point where you cannot defeat higher level
 targets, you will need to either upgrade the building or the Keeper unit,
 whichever is cheaper overall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have lots of luck with the order of events you could quickly reach
 Soul Extractor
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

13 without paying too much attention to the attack buildings (Keeper, Underworld
 Gate, Torture Chamber).
 Unfortunately with the new events that is rarely the case, so when you
 notice the next levels of the important structures cost too much, upgrade
 the Keeper and Underworld Gate a bit in between.
 As was explained earlier, the Gate is pretty cheap, so many people keep
 it the same level as the Hearth of Darkness all the time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have Soul Extractor level
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_layout Standard
As soon as the Extractor hits level 15, focus only on the Gold Pit.
 Unlike other structures the Gold pit can be upgraded even beyond level
 15, but in order to do that, you must first bring all other underworld
 structures to level 15.
 The Gold Pit does not give that much gold before level 25 (eg., at level
 22 it mines 11,465,760 gold per day), so push it to that level non-stop,
 even if that means you won't be able to collect from it.
 The reason for that is after level 25 you are allowed to collect gold while
 it's upgrading, and there is long road to level 100 to make use of that.

\begin_layout Section
How to reach level 110+ in 3-4 days
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Warnings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's first start with some warnings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reaching level 110-120 in first few days of a server is possible, but expensive.
 In the long run it makes no sense, and is a waste of mushrooms, unless
 you are aiming for a top rank on the server.
 Even if that is the case, you can only benefit from that, if you plan to
 keep pushing long-term.
 If you ever stop pushing at the same rate, other players who started slower
 (and cheaper) can catch up with you later, with overall less budget.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, pushing early, and then chilling in eco or free to play mode, is
 a complete waste, and only worth for the thrill.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Primary Goal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ambitious people aiming at top ranks sometimes do that in order to unlock
 Pets, Arena Manager and Underworld sooner.
 In this way they get an earlier advantage to most players in rune bonuses,
 pets, and the gladiator critical damage bonus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
The most important milestone is to reach level 50 at day #2, or at latest,
 in the morning of day #3
\series default
.
 Thus you can start buying epics from the shops before the initial multi-event
 is over.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It helps a lot, if you have a guild with the following requirements:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
4/6 (or 5/5) skills at the very start
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
everyone level 25+ at end of day #1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
everyone HoK 6 at end of day #1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Budget
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Expected cost is between 1K and 2K mushrooms per day
\series default
.
 The exact amount depends on the choice of class, previous experience and
 the guild.
 Given some luck, classes like berserker, scout and druid are more likely
 to defeat dungeon monsters that are of a much higher level than the player,
 so the cost for them is lower than for the rest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's especially true for the berserker, as its rage attack ability sometimes
 allows it to kill an enemy without taking a single hit.
 This is also the only special class ability that also works against mages,
 which makes mage dungeons extremely easy for the berserker class.
 So, if you just want to try fast-leveling as an experiment, it would be
 
\series bold
most cost-efficient to do it with the berserker class
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pace of your progress is also influenced a lot by the guild bonuses
 and HoK.
 To make it cheaper, you need a guild where everyone plans to increase their
 guild skills to 4/6 (or 5/5) with the Starter Pack, at the very start of
 the server.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since in the beginning gem stats depend entirely on the guild HoK, it also
 helps a lot to be part of an ambitious guild.
 Better HoK means better gems and more stats, so you will find it easier
 to defeat dungeons earlier.
 This is only possible if everyone pushes to level 25+ at the end of day
 #1, in order to unlock the Fortress pack.
 The resources from that pack are necessary in order to skip to HoK 6 (costs
 only about ~130 mushrooms).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the steps in this guide have been tested with a battle mage character,
 in an ambitious guild.
 It went a bit outside the budget, but if you use another class, it should
 work better.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Enough blabber, time for action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
General tips
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When changing weapon 
\series bold
compare only maximum damage
\series default
 and stats, ignore minimum and average damage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you can't find a good epic weapon, choose one with main stat only.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
At lower levels you can use the following simple formula to calculate what
 
\series bold
maximum damage to look for in shops
\series default
: 
\shape italic
\bar under
MaxDamage = 3 x CharacterLevel + 15
\shape default
\bar default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
And the following formula for max item stats to look for: 
\shape italic
\bar under
MaxItemStats = 2 x CharacterLevel
\shape default
\bar default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Once you unlock Gem Mine, 
\series bold
only equip items with gem sockets
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
After you unlock Gem Mine, 
\series bold
keep base stats in 50/50 ratio
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Only increase luck while it's cheap.
 Having at least 15-20% chance for critical hits is good to have.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that finding items in shops with maximum possible damage or stats is
 expensive, so if you are given something relatively close to that, just
 take it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Farming gold
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you are low on gold, and need that to raise stats, you can find players
 in the hall of fame that give the maximum gold possible (equal to their
 level), and attack them repeatedly until you steal all the gold.
 After the player drops too much in rank compared to you, you will stop
 earning any gold from him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get around that, spend the gold, unequip as much of your equipment (especiall
y the weapon), and attack him a few times.
 Thus you raise him in rank, while lowering yourself.
 Equip your items again and continue attacking him until your are sure he
 has no more gold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you hear anyone talking about 'farming arena for gold', that is what
 he means.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way to earn extra gold is to buy the 50% mount multiple times.
 Each time you buy it, you get an environmental gold reward.
 But be careful with that, as it is very expensive, especially before level
 35, and you can still progress enough without that.
 Yet, good to know.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you don't have enough gold to buy new equipment, or gems, or whatever,
 the above options can help you to proceed further without doing too much
 quests (saving the thirst for later).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Day 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Goals for end of day #1:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Reach level 26+
\series default
 (34+ for berserkers/scouts/druids), although even a battle mage can reach
 level 31-32 on day #1, as long as you go outside of the budget enough;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Collect 45%-50% of album
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's start:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Join the guild.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Buy the Starter Pack.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Sell the hitpoints potion for 100 gold
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Upgrade your Treasure and Instructor skills to 4/6 (or 5/5, if that is what
 the guild decided)
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Buy small potions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use remaining gold on main stat and constitution (before you unlock gems,
 try to have slightly more main stat than const).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Wait until all 50 players have 4/6 skills and the guild has 40% GOLD and
 60% XP bonuses (or 50% / 50%).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Don't do any arena fights yet, save them for later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Do quests only until you reach level 10.
\series default

\begin_inset Newline linebreak
\end_inset


\series bold
Only choose XP quests!
\series default
 Calculate which quests give the most XP per minute of thirst.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you are a druid, equip the bear mask.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
At level 10
\series default
 stop doing quests, refresh Magic Shop, and 
\series bold
buy Scrapbook
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Equip your character with all items (except Talisman, you can't buy it from
 the shop before level 15).
 At level 10 you can find items with +20 stats (total main+constitution),
 but you need to refresh the shops much more to find those.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Spend remaining gold on stats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Login from another device to get the +5 stats for the achievement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Start attacking players in the Hall of fame in order to fill the album.
 Choose players with different levels and classes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Your goal 
\series bold
at level 10 is to fill about 25% of album
\series default
 before touching quests.
 If you want to have more than that, you need to raise your stats enough,
 so that you are able to defeat higher level players.
 That might be expensive, so you can stop around 25% (550 stickers) and
 continue improving album to +40% at level 15 (when you equip better potions).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Don't forget to spend all gold for stats after each attack.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Do a few quests
\series default
 (hopefully 2-3 only), until you find the 
\series bold
key for the first dungeon
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Since you raised your stats with gold while you were filling the album,
 you might be able to kill the first 3-4 monsters.
 In general the idea is to always 
\series bold
try dungeons before doing more quests
\series default
.
 Clearing a few floors of a dungeon gives you enough XP to level up, which
 means you will later play quests at a higher level, receiving more XP from
 your thirst.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you have a PC and lots of free time, you can save some mushrooms by using
 the Dungeon Simulator from sftools to check the chances for winning a dungeon,
 before actually trying it (https://sftools.mar21.eu/dungeons.html, thank mar21
 from the Tavern Discord for creating this!).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Once blocked at the dungeon, try improving album again.
 You should be higher level now, and can defeat more players with stickers
 you need.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Wait until about 1-2 hours before server reset time
\series default
 (communicate that with your guild first, as some people find that selfish),
 so that more players have increased their guild skills, and there are also
 more stickers available on the server.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Do quests to reach level 15
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Refresh the Magic Shop to 
\series bold
buy a Talisman and medium potions
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Refresh the Weapon Shop and 
\series bold
buy a new weapon
\series default
 (of course also check if other items offered are better).
 You will change all items at level 18 again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Clear 1-2 more dungeon floors.

\series default
 When you reach the Banshee monster (with level 22) you can stop, as it
 is hard to defeat at level 15 for most classes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Around level 15 it should be possible to collect enough gold to upgrade
 your Treasure skill (if you went for 4/6) or Instructor (if you went for
 5/5).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Since you changed equipment and are stronger now, you can 
\series bold
improve album again
\series default
.
 At that level, you can already collect between 30% and 40% of album, how
 much depends on your budget.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Do quests to reach level 18.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Buy new equipment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Defeat 1-2 more dungeons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Improve album again.
 By that time you should have at least 35% of album, but +40% is highly
 recommended.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you have lots of time on your hands, try to get the achievement for 3
 wins in a row against the gambler.
 That gives you only +5 stats on everything, but if you use the `/gold bet
 1` command in the chat box, it doesn't cost much gold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Do quests to reach level 20
\series default
 and to find the 
\series bold
key for the second dungeon
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Try both dungeons again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you are very close to completing a level, do 1-2 quests to close the
 level, before changing items.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Change all items with better.
 At level 20 you can find items with +40 total stats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Improve album.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Next goal is to reach level 25 at reset time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Try dungeons again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you are blocked and want to reach more than level 25 in the first day,
 farm arena, improve stats, change some items and try again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
If you find farming arena expensive, do more quests, but try saving about
 30-50 thirst, so you have some chance to find the key for the third dungeon
 (unlocks at level 30).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you are very close to level 25, but still not there, use your 10 arena
 fights to close the level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
At level 25, if you are a druid, change to cat mask and only use that from
 now on (try bear mask against mages sometimes, but it rarely helps).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
At level 25, build Fortress level 1 and get the Fortress mushroom pack.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The fortress pack gives you 1 level for free, so you will immediately get
 to level 26.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use the resources from the pack to 
\series bold
skip your Fortress to level
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

6 and to buy HoK
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

6
\series default
.
 Use the remaining resources as shown in section 'Early build order' in
 Chapter 2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If everyone in the guild is expected to skip to HoK 6, wait until the guild
 has about 250-300 total HoK (can happen only when most people are level
 25+).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Meanwhile, if you are a druid, try dungeons again without changing any equipment
, but this time with cat mask.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Buy new equipment with sockets.
 From now on never use an item without socket again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Once you unlock gems, 
\series bold
level up your base main and const stats equally
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Farm gold and 
\series bold
skip for gems
\series default
.
 You want more main gems than const gems (eg.
 6 main and 3 const).
 The ratio of your 
\series bold
total main and const stats should be close to 60/40
\series default
 (total, not base).
 You can achieve that with gems and equipment.
 For now it does not matter if the gem is small, medium or big, so use whatever
 you find.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you are a berserker, you can even equip blue gems only.
 That would allow you to kill more harder dungeons (with many tries), but
 will also cost you more tries in easier dungeons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Farming gold for gems at that level is expensive, so 
\series bold
you could stop for 1st day, if you are already over budget
\series default
.
 That way you will also give more time to players in your guild to also
 improve HoK.
\begin_inset Newline linebreak
\end_inset


\series bold
So, if you are already at least level 26, and want to stop for today:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Do 20 spins on the wheel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Spend the gold on guild skills, and whatever remains on stats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Improve album, trying to reach 50%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Finish the remaining thirst.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Wait for reset time.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
If you want to continue pushing beyond level 26,
\series default
 your 
\series bold
next goal is reaching level 30
\series default
 (to unlock next dungeon).
\begin_inset Newline linebreak
\end_inset


\series bold
To do that you need to have some thirst left
\series default
.
 If that is the case:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Farm gold, up stats and change equipment (if you made any levels).
 Around level 30 you can find items with +60 total stats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Farm gold and skip for new gems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Try dungeons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Repeat above 3 steps until you are level 30
\series default
 (if you are a hair's breadth from lvl 30, use any remaining arena fights
 to close the level).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Find the 
\series bold
key to next dungeon in quests
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Spam the new dungeon until you reach level 32.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
At level 32 buy large potions and try dungeons again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Do 20 spins on the wheel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Spend the gold on guild skills
\series default
, and whatever remains on stats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Improve album to 50%
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Finish any remaining thirst.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Wait for reset time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Day 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Goals for end of day #2:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Reach level 60+
\series default
 (berserkers/scouts/druids can do more, eg.
 90+, in that case also check instructions for day #3);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Collect 58%-60% of album
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
main goal during day #2 is to reach level 50+
\series default
, in order to shop for epics.
 Alternatively, as a minimum you could try to reach something close to level
 50, for example lvl 47.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
If you stopped at level 26 the previous day:
\series default

\begin_inset Newline linebreak
\end_inset

First, aim for 
\series bold
level 30
\series default
, in order to 
\series bold
unlock third dungeon
\series default
:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Do quests until you reach level 30.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Find the key to next dungeon in quests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Try dungeons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
At level 32 buy large potions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Change equipment, gems and up stats.
 Around level 30 you can find items with +60 total stats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now that you have large potions and new equip, try dungeons again, until
 blocked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Improve album.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
From now on, if you read 'Try/push dungeons', assume that includes changing
 of equipment and gems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Next goal
\series default
 is to reach 
\series bold
level 40+
\series default
 in order to 
\series bold
unlock 4th dungeon
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Do quests to get to level 40
\series default
, but try to 
\series bold
leave about 100 thirst
\series default
 in order to be able 
\series bold
to find the keys for 4th and 5th dungeons
\series default
 later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you stopped at level 26 the previous day, you might find it hard to reach
 level 40, while saving that much thirst.
 You already know the way to compensate for that - farm gold, improve your
 char and push dungeons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
At level 40
\series default
, use some of the saved thirst to 
\series bold
find the key to dungeon 4
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Try the new dungeon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Around level 44,
\series default
 if you feel this is overrunning your budget, stop for today.
 
\series bold
Level 44 on day #2 is not bad
\series default
.
 If that is the case:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Do 20 spins on the wheel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Spend the gold on guild skills
\series default
, and whatever remains on stats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Improve album to +58-60%
\series default
 or close to that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Finish remaining thirst.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Wait for reset time.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
If you want to continue, 
\series bold
push dungeons until level 50
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
At level 50
\series default
 use some thirst to 
\series bold
find key to dungeon 5
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Farm gold
\series default
 in order to 
\series bold
buy epics
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Fully 
\series bold
equip with socketed epics
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
After getting epics you can 
\series bold
reach level 60+
\series default
.
 Leveling up more is possible, but might be too expensive for most classes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Since 
\series bold
no dungeon unlocks at level 60 (next key is at level 70)
\series default
, you'd better stop for day #2:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Do 20 spins on the wheel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Spend the gold on guild skills
\series default
, and whatever remains on stats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Improve album to +58-60%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Finish remaining thirst.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Start city guard and continue the next day.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsection*
Day 3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Goals for end of day #3:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Reach level 90+
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Collect 62% of album.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two primary goals for day #3 are to 
\series bold
reach level 70
\series default
 in order to 
\series bold
buy the key for dungeon 6
\series default
, and 
\series bold
level 75
\series default
 in order 
\series bold
to unlock pets
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Start with quests, but try to 
\series bold
save about 80-100 thirst for the key and the pet nest
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Don't forget to try dungeons again at every 1-2 levels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you are really blocked, and you don't intend to keep Gem mine at level
 1 for a long time (eg.
 until level 215-225), upgrade Gem Mine a bit, but only a few levels (eg.
 max up to level 3-4).
 If you are berserker, scout or druid, you won't really need to do that
 though.
 You should be able to progress even with Gem Mine 1.
 And keeping Gem Mine at level 1 longer is better, since it will be much
 cheaper (both in terms of gold and mushrooms) to replace gems.
 So do that only as a last resort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When you reach 
\series bold
level 70
\series default
, 
\series bold
buy the key for the 6th dungeon from the Magic Shop
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You already know what to do after you unlock a new dungeon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
At level 75
\series default
 do quests to 
\series bold
find the pet nest
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
If you have more than 50 thirst left
\series default
, try to do only quests, which would allow you to 
\series bold
find some of the pets that boost your main stat or const
\series default
.
 
\series bold
Save about 50 thirst
\series default
 in order to find the 
\series bold
next key
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Don't forget to also fight in pet dungeons, as they give good XP at those
 levels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Once they start selling for about 200 gold, 
\series bold
you can mine gems in order to sell them
\series default
.
 This would probably be profitable only after level 80.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
At 
\series bold
level 80
\series default
 do quests to 
\series bold
find the next key
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Try dungeons until level 85.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
At level 85 skip gems to find the Holy Grail
\series default
 (you already have 1000+ stickers in album), and 
\series bold
hunt for the missing stickers
\series default
 that are available on the server.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you already upgraded Gem Mine to level 10, you might want to extract
 gems from old equipment.
 Of course, when the gems get old, you will still need to replace them.
 The problem is, when you extract the gem, the item is destroyed and you
 can't sell it for gold.
 And you need that gold to buy new epics.
 This is another reasons why it is good to keep Gem Mine at level 1 while
 fast-leveling.
 That way you can just sell your old epics and skip for new gems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
At level 90 the Blacksmith unlocks.
 Shame on me, but I sometimes forget that the blacksmith can add gem sockets,
 and I just keep refreshing the shops for items with sockets...
 Learn from my mistake...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Try dungeons for the last time today.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
At 
\series bold
level 95
\series default
 you can 
\series bold
find the key for dungeon 8
\series default
 (on a quest).
 But since you probably have no thirst left, there is no point to push that
 much.
 Leave that for the next day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Do 20 spins, up guild skills to 10/10, finish thirst, and start city guard
 so that it ends several minutes before reset time (so that you can collect
 the gold reward before the x5 multiplier from the event expires).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Day 4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Goals for end of day #4:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Reach level 110-120+
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Collect 66% of album.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The major goal for day #4 is to reach level 95 and to unlock dungeon 8.
 Once you do that it should be relatively easy to reach level 110.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Do quests to reach level 95.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Find key for dungeon 8
\series default
 in quest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
At some point you might find out that changing epics is just not enough
 to continue, even if you have the best ones.
 If that happens, the reason could be that you neglected your base stats.
 So, remember to also use some of your gold to upgrade the stats.
 You can check how much you need, by looking at other players with a similar
 level to yours.
 You could also use the dungeon simulator, adding arbitrary points to your
 base stats, until the chances of defeating the dungeon become at least
 1%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you don't intend to keep your Gem mine at level
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

1 any longer (eg.
 until level 215-225), it is a good time to 
\series bold
upgrade the Gem Mine to level
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

10
\series default
, and to equip better gems.
 Upgrading the mine helps a lot in dungeons, but, as was already pointed
 out, skipping gems with mine 10 costs a lot.
 Decide that for yourself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Dungeon 8
\series default
 can lead you somewhere around 
\series bold
level 105
\series default
 without much pushing, but to get the next key you need level 110.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The good news is the key for dungeon 9 can be bought from Weapon Shop, so
 you don't have to leave any thirst.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
But don't push yourself too much, even if you don't reach level 110 before
 reset time, you can do that immediately after reset time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
At level 110 buy the next key from the Weapon Shop.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you improve your character enough, you should be able to clear all first
 9 dungeons.
 That will unlock the Tower, and will allow you to get the first pack that
 gives souls.
 You can read more on how to develop the Underworld in Chapter 5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
At level 125
\series default
 remember to 
\series bold
skip gems for the key to Shadow world
\series default
 (you can find that even with gem mine level 1).
 
\series bold
The Twister dungeon gives lots of gold for stats and buying of epics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Once you unlock the Tower, 
\series bold
completely ignore the companions until around level 150-160
\series default
.
 At lower levels you can only use them as extra backpack space, keeping
 useless items longer, so that you have a chance to sell some of them to
 the witch.
