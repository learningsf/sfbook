Recently started a project that aims to create a community book for the game.
The book will be distributed for free, and will be published in PDF, chapter by chapter.
Just finished the first chapter (actually it's numbered Chapter 2), which is about the Fortress aspect of the game, and publishing it here too:

Publishing the first chapter of the book "Learning Shakes and Fidget"





When it's completely finished, will also be published in other ebook-compatible formats.

You can learn more about the book at the project repository: https://github.com/learningsf/sfbook/
